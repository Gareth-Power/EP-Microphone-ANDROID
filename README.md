# EP-Microphone-ANDROID

Hello! I hope you enjoy this app, please see below for use instructions: 

Ensure a pair of stereo bluetooth earphones are connected to the device. 

Insert the name of each embedded participant into the text box above the corresponding button. 

Press a button once to send audio to a single earphone. Press both to speak to both. Press again to mute.

If one earphone is connected, either button will activate audio.

This app was designed and developed by Gareth Power on behalf of the Simulation and Interactive Learning Centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.
